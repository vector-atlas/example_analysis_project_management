## R Markdown template for inhouse github documentation

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for that we most commonly use for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents (for more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>).

However, if you want to document your ideas and have that documentation be the subject of detailed feedback from collaborators or supervisors, then HTML, PDF or MS Word are not ideal formats because: 1) you can't comfortably read the rendered file on github 2) if you want to comment the rendered doc, its a further step to link those comments or issues back to the source code.

The ideal format would look more like your repo `Readme.md`, which renders the formatting of headers, equations, hyperlinks, etc, for human eyes right there in the repo. What normal markdown can't deal with is executing code and producing plots but using R Markdown you can specify the output to produce a github-flavoured variant of markdown, including code, plots, etc.

So how do we do it?

## Set the desired output format

The default output type for `.Rmd` files is `html-document`. Change that. In the yaml header block specify that you want markdown using `md-document`, and then further specify the variant as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
---
title: "documentation about an element of your work"
output: 
  md_document:
    variant: markdown_github
---
```

## The rest is automated
Once you make that change then the rest is taken care of. You can write your documentation in the R Markdown file and then direct your collaborators to read the rendered version on github by linking them to the `.md` output.

When you click the **Knit** button a .md document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r echo=TRUE}
item <- rlnorm(1)
print(item)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk defaults to prevent printing of any R code that generates output in any other chunks.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plot1}
plot(1)
```

## Equations as per usual
As usual, maths notation also works
$\mu$ is mathematical notation

Equation blocks work as per usual
$$N \sim Pois(\lambda)\\
exp(\lambda) \gets \alpha + \beta_1 X1 + \beta_2 X2 + \epsilon_{i,v}$$

## Curious detail for collaborators
Part of the motivation for finding this solution is to include documentation within the repo in a form that it can be read on github by collaborators.

It is possible (though perhaps not desirable) for a collaborator to directly change text in the `.md` doc as you would for the `Readme.md` for example. Any changes would be overwritten in a local repo the next time the parent `.Rmd` file is knitted. That change would be visible in the Diff, though the local repo owner may not be expecting them.  For that reason, it is probably better for issues to be raised citing the `.Rmd` code?

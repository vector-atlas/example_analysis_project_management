## R Markdown template for inhouse github documentation

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for that we most commonly use for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents (for more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>).

However, if you want to document your ideas and have that documentation be the subject of detailed feedback from collaborators or supervisors, then HTML, PDF or MS Word are not ideal formats because: 1) you can't comfortably read the rendered file on github 2) if you want to comment the rendered doc, its a further step to link those comments or issues back to the source code

The ideal format would look more like your repo `Readme.md`, which renders the formatting of headers, equations, hyperlinks, etc, for human eyes right there in the repo. What normal markdown can't deal with is executing code and producing plots but using R Markdown you can specify the output to produce a github-flavoured variant of markdown, including code, plots, etc.

So how do we do it?

## Set the desired output format

The default output type for `.Rmd` files is `html-document`. Change that. In the yaml header block specify that you want markdown using `md-document`, and then further specify the variant as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
---
title: "documentation about an element of your work"
output: 
  md_document:
    variant: markdown_github
---
```

## The rest is automated
Once you make that change then the rest is taken care of. You can write your documentation in the R Markdown file and then direct your collaborators to read the rendered version on github by linking them to the `.md` output.

```{r}
item <- rlnorm(1)
```

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

You can also embed plots, for example:

## Including Plots

```{r plot1}
plot(1)
```

$\mu$ is mathematical notation

$$\beta \gets \mu \leq$$

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
